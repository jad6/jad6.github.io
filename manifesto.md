# Manager Manifesto

After managing projects at Apple for six years, where I led teams of a few members to hundreds of cross-functional and cross-disciplinary colleagues on highly public features, I decided to document the frameworks that proved beneficial to me throughout that time. I believe this will be valuable for my future self, and I hope sharing these frameworks will also be helpful to others.

Many thanks to my mentors, colleagues and beyond for influencing the way I think about these ever evolving topics.

These frameworks are organised into separate sections that can be read in any order. 

## Categorising Problems

Problems are an unavoidable part of life, appearing in various forms and intensities. While we may not be able to solve all problems, we can strategically focus on those that we have the most control over. A helpful way to categorise these problems is to divide them into three distinct types: Type I, Type II, and Type III.

Type I problems are those we have direct control over. They are the most favourable type of problems because they significantly impact us, allowing us to exert considerable influence on their resolution, thereby enhancing the potential return on investment (ROI) for their solutions. For example:

- **Problem:** I don’t get enough time to plan my week because I have too many meetings
- **High ROI solution:** Block time in the calendar (and don’t let non-emergency meetings stomp on it) to plan my next moves

Type II problems are more challenging to influence compared to Type I problems, but we still have some agency in their resolutions. These problems often arise during collaborative efforts, managing up or across, or when we are part of a larger system that is not significantly impacted by our actions. While the outcomes may not always align with our preferences, our influence on the solution is considered. The ROI for this category of problems is considered medium. For example:

- **Problem:** A stakeholder is walking back their commitment due to higher priorities in their org. It’s now putting my project at risk.
- **Medium ROI solution:** Individually I do not have the influence to change that but I can work up the chain to make this a type I problems for my bosses.

Type III problems are beyond our control, but we can anticipate them if we observe them. These are the problems we should just observe and allocate minimal resources to. Ideally, they’ll downgrade to actionable Type II or Type I problems. The ROI for Type III problems is low. Examples include:

- **Problem:** The stock trading policy makes it impossible to sell my shares for the next several weeks
- **Low ROI solution:** Petition for an extremely unlikely change. A better use of energy is to wait for the blackout dates to lift

It’s worth noting that problem categorisation is subjective. What may be a Type I problem for an executive could be a Type II or Type III problem for an individual contributor. Delegating a problem to someone more equipped to handle it may recategorise and increase the overall solution’s ROI.

Categorising problems enables us to prioritise which ones should be tackled or delegated to increase the chances of favourable resolutions to types of problems we can control. 

## Anatomy of a Decision

We make countless decisions daily, from the trivial (choosing between green or black tea) to the significant (whether to let someone go). While not every decision requires meticulous planning, having a framework for more impactful choices is crucial.

Simulating potential outcomes based on current information can guide our decision-making process. The more context we have, the more we can apply second-order thinking to simulate future possibilities. Projections based on relevant context enable us to consider delayed gratification (a classic example being the [marshmallow experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment)) and explore a wider range of outcomes. Very few, if any, impactful decisions should be made without second-order thinking.

To prepare better for more significant decisions, the ones we should truly invest time in, it’s beneficial to simulate different outcomes based on various starting conditions. A useful approach is to simulate the best, most realistic, and worst possibilities. Placing projected outcomes on this spectrum helps us make a more informed decision and prepares us for the eventual reality, which often falls somewhere in between.

The extent to which we can project into the future is limited by the richness of the current context. Therefore, removing assumptions affecting a decision is essential. Once the only assumptions that remain are ones we cannot remove yet, we have established our boundary for how far we can project. More often than not, the remaining assumptions are based on knowledge yet to be acquired and should be reconsidered in subsequent decisions.

Decisions we’ve made and have yet to see their outcomes manifest can become opinions. For instance, shielding an employee from a future project due to our projection that they wouldn’t perform well. That employee could prove us wrong in the coming months, prompting us to reconsider our stance. This reconsideration is crucial to decision-making. A decision isn’t complete when it’s made but rather when we can no longer influence its outcome. It’s essential to be flexible and revisit the decision-making process when the context changes. The book [Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com) aptly captures this concept with the phrase “strong opinions, weakly held”.

Over time, decisions made using projections form a solid foundation of well-thought-out choices. The more confident we feel in our current thinking, the more assured we become in our future decision-making. We learn to trust our past choices and iterate on those that didn’t work in our future decisions.

## Embracing Bad News

We often avoid sharing sharing bad news, preferring to handle problems privately. Unfortunately, suppressing bad news can grow to become unmanageable, causing more damage than necessary. When it becomes evident that the problem cannot be contained, we have no choice but to ask for help. That delay is often what makes bad news so challenging.

We cannot avoid bad news, but we can embrace it as early as possible. Before the problem escalates, sharing it with stakeholders can slow a problem’s severity. Doing so fosters a culture of seeking help and reduces its stigma. When a culture rewards transparency for both good and bad news, it promotes growth, collaboration, and respect by creating a safe learning environment. This culture also enables early adjustment and proactive problem-solving, benefiting both individuals and organisations.

To create and nurture a safe culture for delivering bad news, we should openly acknowledge its inevitability, reward early sharing, and most importantly, separate the bad news from its deliverer. This separation has several benefits. Firstly, it allows the right experts to address a problem that wasn’t discovered by them. Secondly, it reduces ego as we may address something in our area that we didn’t know about. Lastly, it encourages collaboration as bad news can come from anywhere and requires back-and-forth communication to properly address a cross functional problem.

Bad news can actually be beneficial when shared early in a culture that acknowledges its inevitability, rewards early sharing, and separates the news from its deliverer. When handled well, bad news serves as a powerful motivator to build a safe and collaborative culture that is well-equipped to handle unexpected problems.

## Seeing the Forest from the Trees

Large systems are often too complex and dynamic to keep in a single person’s head. So, how can we stay informed and effective within them? A useful approach is to constantly zoom in and out, introducing a healthy dose of perspective into our mental model of the system.

Zooming in and out helps us predict how small changes can lead to larger ones or how large changes can enable more effective small changes. It also encourages us to question our own biases, such as recency bias towards a better understood part of the system. A solid feel of the broader system coupled with patches of deep understanding allows us to find patterns and avoid duplicated efforts.

It can be challenging to switch between zooming in and out, we might be focused on the critical problem du jour for instance. However, these moments are often when we would benefit the most from this kind of perspective. Giving ourselves permission to momentarily let go of our current all-consuming thoughts and zoom in or out to understand their place in the system at large can be a challenging yet beneficial exercise.

When switching our perspective, it’s important to adapt to the relevant context. Often, zooming out means more abstractions and higher-level thinking, while zooming in requires precision and pedantry. Being aware of these differences and switching our thinking allows us to better communicate the state of the system upstream and downstream.

Zooming in and out of a large system provides perspective, enabling effective communication and reducing bias. This approach helps identify patterns, duplicated efforts, and potential impacts of micro and macro changes.

## Do Few Things Great

It’s normal to want to do everything and give it our best effort. However, these goals can often contradict each other, so instead we can aim to do fewer things and at a higher quality. Doing fewer things allows us to give each task more time by reducing context switching costs. 

Accepting that there will often be too many thing competing for our attention can help us keep our current focus and selectively react to a subset of the daily information deluge and focus on keeping our current focus. For example, 100 things might ask for our attention during the day. Half of them won’t get more than a glance. Out of the rest, only about 25 should receive varying degrees of triage. Finally, only three or four should be given deep and uninterrupted attention.

This framework isn’t a license to ignore responsibilities; deciding which responsibility to focus on next is in itself a task to be great at. Doing few things great is a way to organise our mental efforts more intentionally. Combined with good decision-making and when expectations are set, this framework is a surprisingly effective quality accelerator.

## Expect the Expected

Setting expectations early is crucial. If we don’t set our own, someone else will, and they are unlikely to be representative of our intentions. This gap is called mismatched expectations and strongly erodes trust. By clearly defining expectations early during collaboration, we establish the foundation for successful relationships.

It’s possible that conflicts arise while setting expectations which can be uncomfortable, specially if it is early in a collaboration. However avoiding potential resulting tension and disagreement is worse as unresolved expectations undesirably resurface during high-stress periods. It’s better to state expectations and manage potential conflicts early to ensure everyone is on the same page before starting anything meaningfully collaborative.

Setting expectations is half the story, being consistent and following through on promises validates the trust built when they were set, building an effective reputation. This allows people to focus more of their energies on the inevitable surprises that are part of any project and less on mismatched expectations.

Expecting the expected reduces surprises and fosters trust and safety. Consistently setting expectations and diligently following through on them builds upon itself and has a profoundly positive impact on reputation.

## Cultivating the Right Knowledge Trees

As we transition from individual contributors (ICs) producing tangible, specialised work to managing and leading people, the nature of our knowledge shifts from depth to breadth.

As ICs, we are often domain experts, gaining a deep understanding of our work and are able to answer a wide range of questions about it. When we move to managing a small team, we need to become intimately familiar with the work our reports create to guide them effectively. As middle managers, we rely on our managers to summarise the work of their ICs and need to possess sufficient knowledge to provide high-level direction. The further we progress towards leadership, the less intimately we know about the work being created.

Transitioning between these roles can be challenging, as having more intimate knowledge of the work we are responsible for may no longer be as valuable. It can be time-consuming and energy-intensive to maintain the level of details we used to know, and when our organisation becomes too large it becomes impossible. As we transition further into leadership, we should keep many shallower knowledge trees, moving away from the fewer and deeper knowledge trees.

A useful framework to ease this transition is to determine the number of clarifying questions we should be able to answer before reaching our assigned depth of knowledge. For instance, let’s say we are a manager and have decided to be able to answer to three levels of questions about our team’s work. Once we reach our depth of knowledge, we should delegate to the team that will have a deeper understanding of the work.

Deciding on the number of clarifying questions we should be able to answer allows us to assess our understanding of our organisation and work. It also serves as a valuable tool to identify neglected areas that require attention and refreshment. Doing so with the right knowledge tree structure for our role allows us to grow in a scalable manner.

## Finding Interested People

Hiring is one of the most crucial decisions we make as an organisation. The individuals we bring on will become part of our culture and will help shape it. In this sense, an organisation is a living, ever-evolving entity. Therefore, we must be cautious in selecting who will influence these changes. Finding a good match is hard because there is no one-size-fits-all solution. However, there are a few things we can do and pay attention to that can help us narrow down our options.

It is beneficial to identify what can be taught and what is inherent to a person. For instance, learning about how machine learning models are built is a skill that can be taught. However, for someone to grasp concepts quickly and effectively, it helps enormously to be passionate and curious. Attributes such as these cannot be taught. A passionate and curious person enthusiastically pulls others in to share what they love. As the saying goes, “interested people are interesting”. Identifying and prioritising the non-teachable attributes we desire should take precedence when selecting a candidate.

Interviews can be stressful, and to bring out the best in candidates, we need to create a safe and comfortable environment. By doing so, we can gain a much better understanding of what it would be like to work with our potential candidates. Additionally, when candidates feel more secure, they are more likely to showcase their non-teachable skills.

Hiring decisions shape our culture, so it’s crucial to prioritise non-teachable attributes like passion and curiosity during the interview process. By creating a safe interview environment it allows us to get a better idea of what working with a candidate would be like on a daily basis.

## Teamwork Makes the Dream Work

Successful complex projects demand healthy teamwork and continuous collaboration. A healthier organisation yields higher-quality work. Healthy teams amplify successes by celebrating multiple contributors and amortises failures by supporting each other. Maintaining healthy teams and organisations requires consistent effort, and when done well, a frequently collaborating and performing culture emerges.

Healthy relationships foster healthy teams and, consequently, a healthy organisation. When we work with people we can relate to and accept them for who they are, we free up mental energy that would otherwise be spent trying to fit in. As a leader, it’s crucial to care about our direct reports personally and beyond the tasks at hand in an authentic manner. [Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com) encapsulates this well with the advice to “bring your whole self to work”. While creating such relationships beyond your direct reports can be challenging and difficult to scale, it’s important to be approachable and build on relationships throughout sporadic interactions. Over time, personal interactions create a sense of trust and care that directly and indirectly translates to healthier collaborations.

It’s unrealistic to expect constant healthy collaborations because change is inevitable, so we must constantly adapt. In 1965, Bruce Tuckman proposed a framework for [group development stages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman's_stages_of_group_development): forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning (later expanded to include the adjourning stage in 1977 with Mary Ann Jensen).

- **Forming:** This stage sets the stage for a new group or when new members join.
- **Storming:** During this stage, members test their roles and often create conflicts and tensions.
- **Norming:** After the storm, team members settle into their roles and relationships with each other.
- **Performing:** In this stage, the team is competent, autonomous, and able to handle decision-making without supervision.
- **Adjourning:** The team or members depart, and a new cycle begins.

Group development stages occur throughout the lifetime of teams or organisations and are constantly evolving. A team may remain intact in a company structure, but turnover within the team can lead to constant storming and limit its performing potential. It’s beneficial to keep track of important teams and their current development stage so that we can better predict their capacity. Additionally, making groups aware of these stages can be beneficial for self-reflection, reducing conflicts and tensions during the storming phase, for example. 

To navigate changes in group dynamics while maintaining a healthy overall culture, we need to motivate our organisation. A useful framework for this is the [SCARF model](https://schoolguide.casel.org/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/SCARF-NeuroleadershipArticle.pdf), which stands for status (our social standing), certainty (sense of future stability), autonomy (feeling of control), relatedness (trust and safety with others), and fairness (perfection of fair exchanges). These attributes contribute to a threat or reward response in social situations. Humans are motivated by threats or rewards, but rewards are more sustainable and key to creating a healthy environment. To effectively motivate, we should identify which of these attributes impact team members the most and reward them for those.

Implementing these frameworks can be challenging, and we may not always have complete control over how they become part of the culture. A project manager may better control how these frameworks are applied within their team or among their peers. When applied to larger groups and organisations, these frameworks need to be cultivated and passed down to layers of managers, each adding their own perspective. This requires us to lead the culture by example. Healthy examples lead to healthy cultures, which in turn allow more teams to perform for longer periods, and for motivation to naturally arises from within.

## Lead by Recommendation

Throughout a project’s lifecycle, choices need to be made. Depending on their size and impact, these choices often require “decision makers” to help carry the project along. Decision makers can be executives, stakeholders, bosses, or teams. Presenting, deliberating, iterating, and deciding with decision makers is crucial for a healthy and successful project, ensuring that all parties are informed and aligned on the chosen path.

When presenting to decision makers, it’s essential to distill options to a well-researched and viable subset. Decision makers often lack the context and time to fully understand the presented choice ahead of time. Therefore, we should first clearly set the context, considering their prior knowledge and biases. By carefully selecting relevant information, we can provide a tightly scoped and well communicated context that leads to a faster and more informed decision.

Once the context is established, we can present our options. A good practice is to limit options to two to three, allowing sufficient time to thoroughly explore their advantages: why we considered these as viable, and their disadvantages: why we think they are risky. These should be well-thought-out and provoke scoped brainstorms. We should resist the temptation to introduce radically new options during decision-making and instead focus on tweaking or adapting the presented options. If none of the presented options are viable, we should not make a decision and iterate based on feedback. 

When bringing choices forward, we should clearly communicate a recommended option. Stakeholders with the most contextual awareness should discuss and select the recommended option. Recommendations carry broader context and expertise and help inform decision makers of the team’s educated and preferred choice. However, it’s important not to “lead the witness” or overtly favour a recommendation, creating a false dichotomy. Options should be presented with equal merits, along with a recommendation to allow decision makers to choose any option or request further iteration.

Presenting options to decision makers by setting a clear context and providing a limited number of well-researched viable choices is crucial for a well-run project. A recommended option should also be presented with equal merit to enable decision makers to make an informed choice, moving the project forward.

## IOU Collaboration

When working on shared goals, teams collaborate and divide tasks to advance a project. During these collaborations, relationships are formed between teams, inviting a parallel kind of collaboration that extends beyond the project’s lifecycle: IOU collaboration. This type of collaboration occurs when a team helps another with tasks that may not immediately benefit the helper. For instance, we might dedicate one of our team member’s time to assist a partner team with a project they’re running behind schedule on. This creates a positive feedback loop where teams with good relationships help each other in times of need outside of a more rigid structure such as a shared project.

However, there’s a fine balance to IOU collaboration. Helping too much can overwhelm our teams and compromise our own goals, while helping too little isolates us when we need assistance and reduces our potential capacity. It’s crucial to only give favours when we’re in a position of strength. Overextending can lead to burnout within our teams and erode trust from our reports for signing them up for too much and from our leaders for risking our own goals. Therefore, we should volunteer to help others only if we’re in a position to give.

IOUs are only as strong as the relationships we foster. It’s therefore important to build personal relationships before providing or asking for help. Trust and respect are key to IOU collaboration. We must trust that the help we receive will be stable and that our partners will respect us and understand that we’re not asking for their help needlessly. A good IOU collaborations can also alert us early of decisions that could impact us, provide an insider look into other organisational structure, connect us with potential hires, and contribute to a more pleasant and healthy cross functional rapport.

IOU collaboration, where teams help each other beyond project boundaries, fosters relationships and mutual support. However, it’s crucial to strike a balance to avoid overextending and put our teams in jeopardy compromising trust internally and externally.
